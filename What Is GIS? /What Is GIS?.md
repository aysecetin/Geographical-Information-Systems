# *Introduction to GIS*

*Geographic Information System (GIS) is a computer based information system used to digitally represent spatial and geographic features present on Earth’s surface.
‘Every object on Earth can be geo-referenced’ is the primary ideology that makes GIS so successful. GIS is a new planning and analytical tool. It comes with many
advantages as well as drawbacks. The main purpose of this article is to inform the readers about the new technology, application of the technology and the pros and
cons of GIS.*

*Every GIS system is essentially structured around five main components : spatially referenced data, hardware physically storing the data, software assembling the
database, algorithms and data management procedures, and people, both the consumers and producers of spatial data. Every component mentioned increases the
complexity of the GIS architecture and it solely depends on the complexity/scale of the project. The most basic operation that could be done by an amateur is to
create maps by overlapping data stored as tables by adding attributes to all significant geo-coordinates. Once the features are mapped, geo-statistical analysis
such as cluster analysis and network analysis important for applications such as disease monitoring and investigation.*
